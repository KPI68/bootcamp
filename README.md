# Clearco Has The Potential

## Overview and Origin

Being the engine of the modern economy, the financial sector steers the energy - money. Just like any machine, an economy depends largely on its engine. Today, due to the accelerating changes pushed by expected and unexpected factors and events, it is compulsory for the financial sector to evolve by absorbing new nutritions and new components. That is, fintech. Clearco being a new startup fintech of the few viable in Canada, certainly worths a close exam.

The Clearco started in 2015 from a pitch at the Dragon's Den, when Michele, Andrew, Ivan, Tanay, and Charlie built Clearbanc in their Toronto apartment. In 2016 Clearbanc went live in the US. It then got 3 rounds of fundings, each of $15M, $30M, and $125M, respectively from the Emergence and Social Capital, Highland Capital and Softbank Vision fund. With another $60M extension in 2021, the Clearbanc rebranded to Clearco.  


## Business Activities


Clearco's pitch is "revenue sharing". Exactly as claimed in their logo: By Founders For Founders, the goal is to fund founders. There is this common problem for the startup companies to accept equity based venture capital - the capitalists have a say in the company's direction to protect their investments. This in many cases conflits with the originality of the startup. The most famous example was Apple and Jobs. Clearco's "revenue sharing" is an equity free funding method to mediate a win-win situation for both the company and the investor. 

Clearco's main goal is to help eCommerce startups to survive and grow. In today's gig-economy boom, with exceedingly easier applications serviced in cloud, the potential is unlimited. There is no real edge which Clearco enjoys, except for that original idea, which has become popular with a name: MRR/ARR based financing, ie., monthly/annual recurring revenue based financing. Now that the race has begun, the winner would be the fastest in the correct direction. Meanwhile, this market will be large enough to sustain some competitions too.

The technology at Clearco is plain and light-weight web developing tools: Typescript, Vue, Node, SQL. They leverage GCP for database, CI/CD, and API architecture, based on NIX O/S and GitHub. This is a pretty sensible strategy for a startup - focusing on business, adopting practical instead of fancy tech.



## Landscape


Clearco is a relatively new player in the alternative financing ([altfi](https://www.altfi.com/)) domain. While traditionally there have been credit unions, brokers, private equities, such as [AFO](https://alternativefinancingoptions.ca/)  to fund businesses in addtion to banks, recent innovations brought numerous needs and offers in this domain. There are factoring (Receivable Financing, Invoice Financing), [supply chain financing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/supply-chain-finance.asp#:~:text=Supply%20chain%20finance%20is%20a,capital%20at%20a%20lower%20cost), crowdfunding, P2P, B2B, etc., all based on web. There are also many players of different sizes and tenors: As big and mature as SAP ([Taulia](https://taulia.com/)); as medium as [Driven](https://www.driven.ca/) (Formerly Thinking Capital), [Trade Ledger](https://www.tradeledger.io/), [Demica](https://www.demica.com/); plus some direct competitors such as [capchase](https://www.capchase.com/), [re:cap](https://www.re-cap.com/) also up for MRR/ARR financing.


## Results


Clearco has provided 7000+ businesses with $3B+ funding, also created a $10M Creators Fund in partener with [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/). Their 24-hour application-to-cash speed is within the best in trade. Another main measure is everything-online, which is in the blood of Clearco from the beginning. Clearco is performing strongly I believe a lot due to their methodology of supporting the founders from the minority groups, as well as the lack of other performers in the same domain in the Canada market.


## Recommendations

My opinion is that, apart from all the KPIs, the size of fund would actually usher the competitors into different racing tracks. If how much to fund was not considered, the [Futurpreneur Canada](https://www.futurpreneur.ca/en/) would have been the best to go. 


In order to increase the size of fund, it would not be viable only to depend on the venture capticals. Clearco is developing its [Receivable Finance](https://www.velotrade.com/blog/what-is-receivables-financing/) product, which is a good move to up-scale tapping into this novice area in Canada market. To compete with others such as [Fund Through](https://www.fundthrough.com/company/), my recommendation is to leverage this new product, build out a payment capability to reach [Payment Canada's Real Time Rail](https://payments.ca/systems-services/payment-systems/real-time-rail-payment-system), so as to obtain that qualification to join the ecosystem where all the banks are the major players. 

Although "Open banking is not yet available in Canada", says [the government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/banking/open-banking.html#toc3), there are already some, such as the customer identity (KYC) API provided by [MasterCard](https://developer.mastercard.com/open-banking-us/documentation/products/pay/verification-account-owner/). If Clearco prepares itself in this area infrastructure wise, it would not miss the biggest launching pad when Open Banking comes around. This move does not even require much state of the art tricky technology. It would be mainly their existing fast and lightweight solutions super-powered by Google. 

With the big banks on board, the fund sources would become an advantage, not only to sustain and survive, but also to harness that qualification to enter multi-tracks, build and provide more utilities and functionalities, take advantage of newer technology such as AI, blockchain contracts, and help more eCommerce entrepreneurs to grow at ease.
